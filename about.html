		<p>Hey, how's it going?</p>
		<p>I'm Sheldon. I'm an English teacher.</p>
		<p>There are lots of reasons to learn English, and many ways to learn. There's no silver bullet when it comes to learning a new language, but there are some approaches that work better than others.</p>
		<p>Often the most difficult thing for Japanese English students to overcome is their anxiety to get it right. This anxiety can be good for learning maths and science, but when it comes to language, it inhibits our ability to recall existing memories and stops us from laying down new ones.</p>
		<p>English Over Coffee focuses on teaching Japanese English students in a a relaxed, chilled out environment, with the benefit of a beautifully blended coffee (included in the lesson price).</p>
